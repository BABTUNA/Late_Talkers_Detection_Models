What does the doctor do? He gives you medicines that's in a [*] tube that has a needle","21":"on the end and he [*] pushes on your own to your arm and he [*] puts the fluid into your [*] body. So that's something that happens. Is there anything else that happens? He checks your heart. How does he do that? He has [*] things that he puts","22":"in his ear and it's a place that goes [*] down to [*] a little round piece, then he puts it around [*] your stomach. Uh-huh. He puts it around your stomach and that's how he checks. Uh-huh. What else does the doctor do? If you got hurt, [*] you","23":"Well, [*] only if you're sick, you go to the doctor's office, [*] or if you're a doctor, you go there. Right. Okay. When you're going as the [*] patient. When you're going as the patient, you would [*] go there and [*] you would sign up on a list","24":"and wait to be called on. [*] And when you're called on, [*] you would go, you'd follow the person [*] who called on you [*] into an office [*] for the doctor looks. And then they would like check you out [*] if you had strep throat, they would","25":"give you a [*] strep test. [*] Which is when they put like this, [*] they put this little thing with, [*] it's like kind of like [*] this except it's a lot shorter and [*] it has little [*] puff balls on the end of it. So they put","26":"it in your mouth and then they, then they stick it, they rub it in this [*] red, [*] in this red stuff [*] and [*] then the next day or two you get a call. And they tell [*] us [*] if you had strep throat in the mouth.","27":"Okay. So that's how you find out if you have strep throat or not. What else happens at the doctor's office? They [*] take your temperature [*] sometimes [*] and [*] if you have a fever, you definitely should go to the doctor. And [*] they [*] also, [*] they","28":"[*] also take your heartbeat. How do they do that? The heartbeat? They [*] have [*] this little [*] wire that comes up to their ears and they put it in your ears. [*] And then the wire attaches, [*] like the wire from two ears they attach. And then","29":"there's one thing that has like [*] a little [*] stuff [*] to describe. What does it look like? It looks like [*] kind of like [*] a bicycle wheel, [*] except it's all filled. Okay. [*] And then [*] that's how you, they can hear it [*] because [*]","30":"they can hear your heart pumping. So [*] that's how they check your heartbeat and what else happens at the doctor's office? [*] They, [*] do [*] they have any [*] specific [*] clusters? No. Okay. [*] You can also, there are cells that they, [*] they show you. And,","31":"Well, he just looks at you to make sure that you don't have any [*] cold, sometimes he'll give you a [*] needle, [*] and [*] he'll take a little stethoscope, [*] like a little [*] popsicle [*] stick, and [*] put it [*] on your tongue, press down so","32":"you can see your tonsils. So sometimes he'll use a popsicle stick and press down and look and see your tonsils, and you mentioned [*] something called a stethoscope, [*] can you tell me a bit about what that is? I like, it shows [*] a little bit of how","33":"your brain [*] works, [*] it just looks [*] inside your ear, it's a little [*] light, and then it's a magnifying glass too, [*] and [*] it's really small, and then it comes out like this to look big, and you just look in the big part [*] with","34":"the lights on, and you can see inside people's heads. Oh, okay, and that's the stethoscope? Can you tell me anything else about [*] what happens when you go to the doctor's office? I'll go check your reflexes. Oh, how does he do that? He'll take a little, like, thingy","35":"thingy thingy, [*] and [*] you have the [*] backing, [*] and [*] you feel like an eraser [*] that comes down, [*] and he just presses on and he taps your knee, [*] and it gives up your reflexes, good. He [*] doesn't obey with me, sometimes he'll do","36":"One reason to go to the doctor's [*] office is [*] either you get really really hurt [*] or [*] it's just [*] your monthly [*] check up [*] and see how you're doing [*] and [*] maybe you have to go there because you know because your brother is","37":"[*] getting a check up and your sister [*] has to go. So those are some of the different reasons you would have to go. Can you tell me what [*] usually happens when you go for your check up? [*] Yeah [*] umm [*] doctor checks [*] me out","38":"and he sees [*] how much I weigh and that's all I've [*] got. So he checks how much you weigh and that's all you've got and what else does the doctor do? And sometimes you can do a seeing test. A seeing test? Does the doctor do anything else","39":"[*] on a check up? Doctor do anything else. Well you're done check up. You might get a wobbly pop. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. At the end? Uh-huh. Anything else to check up? Um he might tell you if you have to take medicine, what kind of [*] medicine you need","40":"to take. Uh-huh. Okay. Don't take too much of it. Uh-huh. Okay. Sometimes it's liquid so many times it's frozen. Uh-huh. So he might talk to you about that? Yeah. You also mentioned that sometimes you go to the doctor if you get really hurt. Yeah. Can you tell me","41":"what happens? Uh like [*] okay um [*] let's say [*] you, [*] you have emergency, let's say you were standing on top of that pointy house like that. Now you're from out of space [*] so you think you can do that? Mm-hmm. Because? Because what do I know?","42":"Right? I'm from out of space. Yeah. And [*] standing on the tip like that on Mars would be like a piece of cake. Right. Mm-hmm. But [*] here on [*] Earth [*] you stand [*] on [*] top of that, you [*] probably couldn't keep your rounds on them.","43":"You probably fall off that way and hit [*] your back against both. Earth [*] fall that way, hit your head against that wood piece right there. [*] Okay. Mm-hmm. And then I'd have to go to the [*] doctor, right? Yeah. And what would the doctor do? And what","44":"would he [*] do? Mm-hmm. [*] Well, he would [*] check your head, he would check your back. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. [*] See if any [*] broken bones, see your [*] skull. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And [*] even those sweaty parts don't, [*] don't stand on [*] something [*] little [*]","45":"like this. [*] Okay. Mm-hmm. Because even [*] then, you fall backwards like this. Kaboom. You fall this way. Right? You fall over the table. Mm-hmm. Or you might kick this part. Wow. So that's a lot of things that could happen. And then you just kick [*] here. Mm-hmm.","46":"And kick here. I mean. That's a lot of different things. Yeah. But so I'd go to the doctor and [*] he would take care of it, huh? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Probably he'd play the [*] work. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I was going to have to go to work. Mm-hmm.","47":"Well, the doctor checks up on you to make sure [*] you aren't getting any kinds of [*] diseases so you can [*] stay healthy and not get sick. Okay, so the doctor checks up on you to make sure you're not getting any [*] diseases. Mm-hmm. Tell me more","48":"about [*] what the doctor does and how he or she checks up on you. He checks your [*] pulse, he checks your [*] heartbeat. Mm-hmm. Your pulse, your heartbeat. Tell. With this [*] kind of tool. Mm-hmm. And [*] if [*] they want to see your blood, they give","49":"you like a needle and there's a big [*] tube attached to it. Mm-hmm. And they stick it in here and [*] pull it out and pulls out some of your blood. Mm-hmm. And then you take the needle out and then you put a band-aid on [*] where your","50":"[*] shot was and then they can check your blood to see if you have any kinds of diseases. [*] Oh, so that's how they check your blood. Mm-hmm. Okay. Does the doctor ever check anything else? [*] Yeah. If you broke a [*] leg, [*] you [*] see how","51":"[*] you get her to take an x-ray [*] of it and they put a [*] cast on it. Mm-hmm. So [*] then it would heal. So that it would heal, okay. Does the doctor ever give you anything? Yeah. If you're [*] sick, [*] he'll give you [*] a","52":"[*] prescription [*] and then you go to your [*] first drug. Mm-hmm. You have to tell him where your next drug is. Mm-hmm. And then they send a [*] prescription there and then [*] you'll have it for you and then you'll go pick it up. Mm-hmm. And you'll","53":"So sometimes they poke something in you to make sure you don't get anything bad and also to make sure [*] that you don't have anything. What else do they do at the doctor's office? They look at the [*] reflexes and they look at the other [*] reflexes. What","54":"are reflexes? They look at [*] the [*] ears and the mouth and the ears. They look at the [*] eyes. Wow, is there anything else that they do at the doctor's office? [*] They [*] check if you [*] broke your arm and [*] you're not quite sure. If","55":"you're not quite sure, they'll check it out for you [*] and see if it's broken. How do they do that? They feel the arm and they feel the bone in place. They [*] feel the bones are in place. Is there anything else that they do? [*] Well, they","56":"check out if you're working on your fingers if you can't really do that now. It's broken [*] and they can be spoiled as well. But if you can wiggle your fingers fine, then you're fine. [*] Is there anything else I should know [*] about the doctor's office? [*]","57":"They [*] take [*] blood. Oh, they take blood out? Uh-huh. My legs are in the mouth. Uh-huh. They're in the mouth. Somebody burns a lot of blood. [*] If you're a girl in your house, they take a lot of blood. You can volunteer. Oh, you can [*] volunteer","58":"He looks in your mouth and in your ears. Does he use anything special to do that? Or does he just look for the eyes? He uses a stick for the mouth and ears.

doctor knows things about your body and what you should get [*] like [*] people make Tylenol","71":"[*] and [*] then they have this like [*] machine test [*] like if [*] it needs it and it still stays like a color [*] then [*] then that means it's no good [*] but if it eats it in it [*] and it turns [*] the color I","72":"forget what color it is [*] it eats it [*] yeah it like if you put it in like a little box and then it takes in it [*] oh okay it [*] doesn't really eat it right it [*] I [*] don't get how they make machines [*] don't","73":"ask me [*] but I'm not a [*] scientist but that's what they do and [*] and they mix these different [*] ways [*] and so [*] and what a doctor does [*] is he knows a lot about things you know [*] if [*] he um he sometimes gives","74":"you [*] shots [*] the reason I was complaining about it doctor it is it's just I had more things to do I [*] sometimes like playing battle-toes which isn't intended on your day off [*] well [*] when you do go to the doctor what's the first thing that","75":"happens when you go in you go [*] right into the office [*] it depends if you're going to the [*] dentist doctor because that is a doctor doctor like when you go for a checkup okay [*] the first thing [*] you usually lie down [*] and the second","76":"thing [*] that's it [*] sometimes the doctor [*] if the doctor's right there then I mean [*] you know you're right mm-hmm [*] and but sometimes you [*] have to go on this one thing is right now oh [*] okay [*] and [*] I can't really [*] explain","77":"what happens next it's [*] sometimes that the doctor asks you [*] um [*] what what [*] if you've been feeling any pain on [*] her [*] side [*] yeah [*] no I have on this side that's because I felt the tongue [*] and I went to the doctor","78":"[*] of the [*] school uh-huh [*] nurse where [*] and I and she said I'd bruised a bone over here [*] so the doctor wouldn't care about that [*] because [*] I mean it's already [*] been taken care of [*] so when you go into your [*] regular","79":"doctor like if your dad takes you or something you go in you lie down [*] and he asks you if you've had any [*] pain [*] and then [*] he [*] asked you [*] questions [*] and [*] sometimes [*] you um [*] he feels your pulse [*] he","80":"um [*] he [*] sees how good your heart rate's going to see if you're a [*] perfect fit you know not perfect but [*] how [*] good you are right [*] it's just [*] to check that out right and when [*] he's often is checking all those things","81":"out [*] then do you go out of like out of the examining room and then what happens not [*] not [*] always [*] sometimes [*] he when he when he checks wait when he's finished doing that he [*] writes is before all when he does and [*] then","82":"what he does [*] is sometimes he asks you [*] questions [*] he doesn't always ask you at the [*] beginning [*] oh he [*] sometimes can ask you at the end [*] and sometimes oh right he doesn't want he [*] wants to ask the [*] beginning [*] but","83":"he wants to [*] still have time to do all the rest of this right well that's good yeah [*] so sometimes he doesn't it those times [*] and [*] also usually at the end [*] but usually at the end what you do is [*] if the very end","84":"[*] sometimes [*] he just checks your pulse again [*] because sometimes [*] if he checks your pulse one time he wants to see if it's [*] beating a little [*] slower right it [*] should be because and sometimes if it's [*] not [*] it's a [*] problem [*]","85":"because you can have you know a [*] bad [*] sickness [*] because like if you're if you're really [*] working out [*] and [*] your heart's still [*] beating [*] the next time you work out it beats [*] faster right [*] faster faster faster [*] until [*] I","86":"mean it's going [*] that fast [*] and that's really bad cuz you'll be [*] dead so [*] the doctor so [*] fast yeah well the doctor checks your heart and how does he do that [*] he is that you have these [*] things that my [*] Nancy [*]","87":"which is my aunt had and let let me [*] see what it is [*] and what and what it does it some people [*] think it just [*] tells you what your heart [*] but since I've seen these in [*] it [*] like [*] if you feel your","88":"heart yeah you can feel it beating and if you listen to your heart you can [*] listen to me [*] what it does is is it has this [*] thing and [*] if you were like that it would be a lot louder than [*] you would think so","89":"what it does it is it makes it [*] louder and you can hear it louder you're like this [*] mm-hmm [*] right it [*] hurts [*] it it'll hurt your ears if you go boom yeah [*] I've done that before [*] so is that all the things that","90":"happen when you go to the doctors [*] he checks your heart [*] you lie down [*] he sometimes asks you how you're feeling at the beginning but [*] sometimes [*] if you're [*] sick if you're going to the doctor because you're [*] sick [*] then what he'll do","91":"is he'll like [*] check you you know like he'll give you shots it like he finds first finds out what's [*] wrong [*] then he'll [*] sometimes if it's [*] bad he'll give you a [*] special [*] shot [*] and sometimes he can tell you to [*] go","92":"and sometimes if it's so bad even if you don't know he'll tell you to go to the [*] Hummer yet what's the call your [*] hospital yeah [*] if it's really really bad [*] because before you go to the hospital you're supposed to go to the doctor right","93":"sometimes [*] you have to get a shot there sometimes you have to get a shot [*] um [*] and [*] they [*] see if you're [*] doing okay [*] and [*] um [*] um [*] and if you [*] don't um feel so good they can they can just","94":"[*] give you something [*] and then you'll feel better oh okay [*] like [*] medicine [*] uh-huh so um [*] to [*] have like [*] you can have it like every day or once a week mm-hmm [*] so maybe that sort of [*] depends on how sick you","95":"are [*] yeah [*] is there anything else that happens at the doctor's office um sometimes the doctor's office will have a balloon for you or like [*] or um sometimes they'll give you a balloon or a [*] sticker [*] or something oh that sounds pretty good [*] do","96":"When a doctor checks you, you feel like [*] you're [*] sick or anything. Sometimes he has to give you a needle. He takes your [*] temperature, and if you're sick, [*] there's just some [*] medicine. [*] Sometimes [*] he [*] checks your heart. [*] He [*] checks your","97":"ears [*] and eyes. How does he check your ears? He uses some kind of thing that he holds, and [*] he [*] can use something that can make it feel nice. I see. Is there anything else that the doctor does? I don't know. Is that about it? Okay.","98":"Oh, you either go [*] for a checkup [*] to make sure [*] your body is in good shape [*] and you don't have like a lot of [*] germs in or you're not going to get into these or [*] something [*] that can affect your body. [*] Now","99":"try if there's a [*] Mars doctor though. [*] I'm not sure if there are doctors on Mars. [*] And [*] the other thing is [*] when [*] you go if you know you're [*] providing your feelings [*] or you had a lot of headaches recently [*] and you","100":"go to the [*] doctor's and [*] he'll find out what's [*] happening to your body and cure it. Can you tell me a little bit [*] more about what happens when you go in for the [*] checkup? What do you think is going to happen? First, he [*]","101":"checks your ears. He has [*] special equipment that [*] lights up inside your ear. [*] It certainly doesn't feel very good. No, it doesn't. I don't like it. No. No. He's with your ears. And he could see, [*] look around the ear. [*] I don't know if there's","102":"anything wrong in there. [*] Then he checks the other ear. Then he [*] shines the one in your eye. The one in your eye? Yeah. [*] Try to look [*] behind your eye. I've done this. [*] I started with [*] my friend [*] John, [*] his dad, [*]","103":"who [*] is a doctor. Oh, wow. He went to his office. And got to do it [*] with his eye. Wow. Sounds like it. So what else happens [*] during your checkup? He [*] checked your heartbeat to make sure it's not going... Well, to make sure it's going","104":"the right [*] speed. And how does he check your heartbeat? Just the thing that he puts on your heart. [*] And [*] it [*] makes it a whole lot easier for [*] it to hear [*] because [*] it's closer to the heart. [*] He puts two plugs there","105":"[*] in his ears that are attached. And he could hear. So it's a special thing [*] that helps him hear your [*] heartbeat. Is there anything else the doctor does? To me, he goes like this, like that. [*] On your stomach and on your back. It feels like","106":"[*] he's giving you a [*] massage. [*] I [*] don't know why he does that. What else happens? [*] Sometimes when you go because you feel like something. [*] My dad [*] had to have my tonsils taken out. And [*] we had to [*] go take an x-ray.","107":"[*] Sometimes you take x-rays and you go through this. [*] And you lay down on the machine. And it [*] looks inside your body like some kind of light or something. So [*] the doctor could see what's happening in the belly. There's a special part for your brain.","108":"Or my neck. So that he can see what's going on. Are those all the different things that happen when you go to the doctor's? Do you think of some workers? Does the doctor get [*] stickers? Or a lot of props. And when does that happen? At the end.","109":"And also [*] sometimes you get [*] shot. I'm a stretcher. My sister likes him. And she [*] surprised everybody in the room. Put medicine through your [*] body [*] to [*] prevent [*] stuff from [*] happening. Like [*] diseases [*] or [*] sometimes [*] cures. [*] If you","110":"have a [*] sickness or something, [*] go down to a [*] pharmacy. [*] Go down to a pharmacy. Then go down to [*] McDonald's. [*] After the doctor's? [*] After the doctor's. You can get special medicine. Wow, you told me a lot about what happens when you go","111":"to the doctor's office. [*] I think I [*] definitely know enough to go back and fill in the other Martians.

Yeah? I always try to [*] make, if I know, I have a little [*] cord that I get. Like a finger [*] to go there. Oh my goodness. [*] What do you like so much? What do you like best","113":"about it? I like the [*] McDonald's from it. Oh yeah. That's sort of the treat afterwards, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's in the same building. [*] Also, by the children's [*] hospital, [*] two buildings. And one building I really like because it has McDonald's. The other guy hates. That","114":"[*] What kind of sickness do you want? When [*] you have a sickness? You look like. Oh, um, any kind.

[*] We [*] wait for about [*] five minutes [*] and [*] then he comes in and then he [*] checks your [*] lungs and your [*] ears and your [*] mouth and your [*] nose [*] and stuff. And then","116":"he [*] gets [*] a [*] little, like, [*] sticky thing in. [*] Like, gets [*] something on, like, [*] consoles. Uh-huh. I [*] forget what it's called. And then [*] he goes around and [*] they [*] put, it was, it was like [*] pus. And then the [*]","117":"the doctor's office like if you get [*] sick and [*] you had to go to the doctor's [*] office [*] like [*] see what's like wrong with you and then you have to get like [*] medicine [*] like pills like what quit [*] or [*] sprinkle [*] then","118":"you can like [*] like take them and they'll help you get [*] better [*] with like [*] allergies like [*] cold.

[*]","120":"You [*] can get back in the car and go home. How [*] does the doctor know what's wrong with you? [*] If you have a sore throat [*] it has this like thing that checks in the back of the [*] throat [*] and if it's [*] like spray","121":"[*] and you have to [*] let this check through and if you have [*] a [*] dizzy [*] spell [*] then [*] he [*] doesn't know that you have a dizzy spell but you [*] do so you might have to tell him like [*] things that you can't","122":"[*] like [*] it [*] is not really sure of.

[*] So you tell him about those things [*] to help him figure","124":"[*] a doctor, [*] either be a boy or a girl, [*] and [*] they like [*] take your blood pressure, right, and you [*] pain [*] your [*] temperature of your body, [*] and they [*] see if your throat is right, or if your eyes are burned, or","125":"if your ears are feeling good, and you tell them what is hurting them and they look at them, like if your [*] foot [*] is broken, they'll look at your foot and take an x-ray, and it's going to be able to cast on it, [*] and then they","126":"tell you what kind of medicine to take, or if you're [*] sick [*] or something, and they tell you how long you should stay out of school or something. They tell you lots of things, don't [*] they? What was that you were talking about in the beginning? You","127":"said something about taking your blood pressure. [*] Well then, there's [*] a [*] piece of cloth that they put around hand, there's a little wire that attaches to [*] the thing that's squeezed, and [*] that thing that's squeezed, that looks like a clock, but it's not, [*] but","128":"it goes higher in [*] numbers, [*] and then you [*] squeeze it five times, and you see how high the thing is, and if it's [*] really [*] high, you have a really high blood pressure, it's [*] medium, and then you have a [*] good blood [*] pressure.","129":"If it's really low, then you have [*] a bad blood [*] pressure.
