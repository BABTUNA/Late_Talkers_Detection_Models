Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. So that's another way to stop. How do you [*] turn? You turn, [*] the front wheel turns, [*] and there's handlebars where the hand brakes are, [*] and so you turn the handlebars, which makes the front wheel turn. So that's how you turn, and you've told me how you stop,","2":"[*] Well, it has these [*] chains, these pedals, [*] and you get on the bike, [*] and [*] it has a tick stand, like if you want to stop, [*] and [*] you [*] get on the, you get on it, and you hold on to the handlebars, [*] and you put your feet on the pedals, [*] and you [*] pedal, and you pedal around, [*] like [*] a [*] circle. [*] And [*] then that gets the bike started, and then you can just keep doing that. So that's what makes it [*] go. What makes it","3":"stop? Well, you can either have [*] handbrakes [*] or [*] footbrakes. What are handbrakes? Handbrakes are after on the pedal, or [*] after on the handlebars, and you just [*] sort of like, [*] well, a [*] candle. [*] And you just [*] push it, and that [*] stops it, and then footbrakes are, you can [*] just sort of, you can [*] pedal backwards, and that will stop it. Okay, so footbrakes are when you pedal backwards, and that stops the bike. Can you try to explain to me, how does pedaling backwards stop the bike? Does that","4":"work? Well, [*] because it [*] does something to the [*] chain. It does something to the chain, yeah. And then the chain [*] sees that, [*] and then the chain sees that, and then it just stops. And then the chain stops. [*] I see. And [*] how do you turn [*] when you're riding a bike? Oh, well, you just turn the handlebars. If you want to go this way. If you want to go straight, you just go like this. If you want to turn, you turn the handlebars. Uh-huh, like that. Yeah. Oh, [*] and [*]","5":"what holds the bike up? Wheels. Can you explain more about that? Wheels, a [*] body, and [*] a [*] chain. Wheels, a body, and a chain. [*] How do the [*] wheels hold the bike up? Well, there's little [*] things for the wheels and the bike. [*] That's where you put the wheels, and that's how the [*] wheels hold the bike up. And how does your body hold the bike up? Well, [*] your body doesn't hold the bike up. No. No, [*] not at all. Okay. Um, and... Oh, yeah, your body does hold the bike","6":"up. [*] No, you gotta sort of practice on a two-wheeler bike. You gotta get balanced. Uh-huh. And if you're not balanced, it'll just fall off. Oh, you have to get balanced. And what does [*] balanced mean? It [*] means, like, you want to, like... If I wanted to walk like on a very [*] straight... If I wanted to... If [*] you go to that circus and see a tightrope walker walk on the line, you have somebody go like this. Oh. Here's the balance. That's what balance means. I see. So there's some way that that works","7":"There's this [*] chain, [*] and there's a gear [*] that [*] turns around, spinning the [*] chain, [*] and the chain moves the pedals. [*] It [*] helps the pedals move when you [*] push them with your feet. And [*] there's like a [*] steering [*] thing [*] that you move back and forth [*] steering. They're big wheels [*] that help you get around on it, [*] and it's just a source of transportation. And it's a source of [*] transportation, [*] okay. I [*] think that [*] explains to me how the bike moves. Can you","8":"explain to me how you stop the bike? Well, on [*] some bikes, all you do is pedal backwards. Oh, I see. And in other bikes, the buttons, or knobs, [*] you pull back. They're knobs that you pull back. And how do those stop the bike? [*] Well, it [*] stops [*] the [*] chain, the gear from moving, would stop the [*] chain, which [*] doesn't allow the pedals to move. [*] I see. [*] I see. [*] And what holds the bike up? Steel. Steel holds it up. When you're riding along, is that what keeps it","9":"[*] Well, [*] what [*] kind? We all are a two wheeler. Tell me about the kind that you have. I have a two wheeler. You have to keep your balance on the bike. You keep your balance. And [*] I think if you go really [*] fast, you get better balance. And what you do is you [*] pedal on your... You have pedals and you push them and [*] they can go from the wheel. And [*] then the chain is attached to that. [*] Which [*] goes [*] and hooks onto your front wheel. Or [*] back.","10":"[*] I forget which one it is. And then I think it's the back wheel. Which makes the front wheel work. And then when you steer... It's [*] probably the back wheel. When you steer the [*] front. So [*] when you move the pedals and there's the back wheel. And then [*] when the back wheel moves, the front wheel is normally the back wheel. The front wheel is normally [*] really [*] smooth. So it goes round and round [*] the back wheel. [*] And it [*] both moves. [*] And then [*] there's a [*] bar that's","11":"hooked onto these [*] little [*] metal things that come out of it. And this rim that is [*] inside the [*] wheel. And then [*] that metal thing that comes out of the rim of the bike wheel. [*] There's a little [*] metal piece in [*] between of those little bars of the [*] wheel. And then there's a bar that's hooked [*] onto them that goes up. And then there's handles on the side. Which we use. And then that is used to [*] steer the wheel. And then [*] you have a bar [*] across the","12":"[*] top. Which is over the chain. And that is [*] for another bar on top of that. [*] And then there's a [*] seat on top of that for us to sit. So when you sit on the [*] seat [*] you can put your [*] feet on the [*] pedals [*] and still be able to hold onto your buttons. And how do you make the bike [*] stop? When you pull back on your [*] pedals, [*] that [*] will [*] sound like a seat belt on the [*] train. [*] There's little wheels that are attached","13":"to the [*] chain. [*] And [*] the [*] wheels are attached down to the pedals. And they're attached to the chain. [*] And [*] the wheels cannot go backwards. [*] So [*] when you do pull [*] backwards, [*] the [*] wheel [*] will [*] stop the [*] chain. Which will stop the back wheel. Oh, okay. [*] But [*] in other bikes, [*] some other [*] bikes, they [*] have handlebars up here. [*] But one doesn't. And it [*] pushes pressure [*] and puts air, which there's a torque under here. And that's why [*] there's two","14":"little [*] pads. And they're [*] attached to the [*] front wheel. So when you pull the [*] thing back, [*] it will stop your front wheel. And [*] normally [*] some of the things that have that [*] will have [*] on their pedals a couple of wheels on it. So you can attach [*] to [*] put your [*] chain on [*] anything. [*] And then [*] on theirs, if you pull back, it's called freestyle. Freestyle. And it's like when you pull back, [*] it [*] won't stop the bike. But the [*] pedals, the [*] things","15":"up here [*] will. The things up here. And what are the pressure [*] handles? [*] I don't [*] know. But I think they're like handles. They're like [*] handles. [*] They're like [*] things [*] that are [*] above [*] your handles that come out of the bar. And they have little things that [*] stop the front of your wheel. And that will stop the back wheel. Because you can't have your back wheel moving [*] at the same time your [*] front wheel's not moving. [*] And then [*] when you pull back on your [*] pedals,","16":"[*] Well, [*] there's [*] these [*] chains that are greasy, [*] and when you pedal on the chains, you move the wheels on each [*] side, so you can move with the light. And [*] there's these pedals, you have to do it with a steering wheel, and that's it with steering things, and you pull around wherever you want to go. [*] So you're talking about [*] pedals and a [*] steering wheel and [*] chains, and pulling it around wherever you [*] want to go. [*] What makes the pedals go? [*] The pedals, [*] well, it's","17":"kind of like a screw, and the screw makes that, this [*] metal thing that hooks onto the pedals, makes that go around, and the pedals go around with them. Okay. [*] And, so that's what makes it go, and how do you stop it? Well, [*] you either have [*] handlebar, right, [*] the whole round tube, and there's usually something you pull on, [*] and the bike stops, or you have pedal brakes, [*] where you put your foot [*] down and it stops. I see. And what holds the bike up? The bars. Bars hold the bike","18":"up? Can you tell me a little more about that? The other [*] guy, like, one bar might be going this way to hold up those two bars together. Another bar might be coming down to hold up the [*] seat. Another bar might be holding up the wheels. Okay. And how about when you're riding the bike, what holds it up? The wheels. The wheels hold it up. Okay. And how do you turn? [*] Well, you have the steering wheel. Like, say you want to turn [*] right, and then you left. [*] Right. You will push it","19":"You press on the pedal, and [*] the pedal's hooked onto a chain, and the chain's hooked onto your tire, then the back, then your tire moves. So you press on the pedal, the pedal's hooked to a [*] chain, the chain's hooked to a tire, and that makes your pedal move? [*] Tire moves. Oh, your tire moves, okay. [*] And, um, [*] so that's what makes it move. I think that makes sense to me. But what makes the [*] bicycle stop? How do you stop your bicycle? You [*] squeeze a handle from the side, and there's","20":"a wire that goes through a pipe, and it goes to the brakes and [*] stops the bike. It goes to the brakes and stops the bike? Can you tell me a little bit about brakes? What are they? What do they look like? They're rubber. And... So they're made of rubber. Anything else you can tell me about brakes? Yeah. Okay, so brakes are made of rubber, [*] and you were telling me about them when you were [*] describing how to stop the bike, right? [*] Okay, [*] so you've told me what makes the bike go. You've","21":"told me how to stop the bike. I'm wondering, [*] say you're riding your bike and you want to turn, [*] how do you do that? There's [*] two handles, and you [*] pull on one side, and then you push on the other side, and [*] then you turn. Oh, so when you pull on one side and push on the other side of the handles, then you turn? The tire is hooked onto a pull [*] on the handles, and then the tire turns when you turn the handle. I see. So the tire turns when you turn","22":"the handle, [*] okay. [*] And [*] what holds the bike up when you're riding on it? Balance. [*] Balance. What's [*] balance? Balance to fight the [*] gravity [*] pull [*] from the Earth. So balance fights the gravity pull from the Earth. [*] Can you kind of tell me a little more about that? [*] Like how [*] balance keeps the bike [*] up? [*] It sounds like you have a really good idea of how that works. [*] If there weren't any [*] balance fighting the gravity [*] pull of the Earth, what would happen? You fall","23":"Well, some of them have [*] four wheels, [*] and that's for like little things. And I have a two wheeler, which has two wheels. And [*] wheels are like round things [*] that are rubber. [*] And [*] it works, [*] there are pedals, and [*] there are [*] also like [*] little [*] chains [*] that are [*] attached [*] to your wheels, so you can pedal, and it makes your wheels work. [*] Okay, so you pedal, and the chain makes the wheels work, so that's what makes the bike go. What else can you tell me","24":"about how the bike works? Well, there are two kinds of brakes. [*] There are hand brakes, [*] and the only one you should really use is your right one, [*] because your right one is for the back wheel. And if you used your [*] left [*] one, [*] it's for your front wheel. And if you used it too fast, you could put both on. And [*] the other kind of brake [*] is [*] the pedal brake, where you can just [*] push your pedals back, and it will [*] stop. And [*] then [*] I have","25":"two kinds of brakes. We have both kinds. But I only have a right one, [*] which I think is a lot smarter. [*] Yeah. [*] And [*] that's pretty much all. [*] How do you steer the bike? There are hand brakes. [*] There's a bar across. [*] And [*] you can... And then there are like... [*] And then [*] you can hold on to it. [*] And you can turn it [*] any way you want, [*] and it will turn that way. I see. And what makes the bike stop? If you go backwards, it [*]","26":"stops. If you go backwards? Well, if you push the pedals backwards... If you push the pedals backwards, it stops. Or if you [*] have a hand brake like this, if you pushed it in, [*] it would stop. I see. And [*] what holds the bike up? The wheels. Tell me more about that. The wheels hold it up. And then [*] there's... And [*] the inside of the wheels are like metal. And [*] there is a [*] bar attached to that. So that holds the [*] main part of the [*] bicycle up. So it holds like","27":"[*] There's two things on each side of bicycle car [*] panels, [*] and they both go [*] like this. They both go like that. And there's handles up here, and [*] two wheels, and then the pedals go inside the wheels, and the chain's back here. Oh, the chain? [*] The [*] chain [*] turns the wheel, and the pedal, [*] and then it's [*] wheeled front, [*] and it [*] looks onto the handlebars, and you [*] pedal with your [*] feet, [*] and you turn the handlebars to make it go around in [*] some place. So","28":"you pedal with your feet, and that moves the [*] chain, and then the chain turns the wheels? Yeah, the handlebars [*] turn the wheels. Oh, the handlebars turn the wheels. And what makes the wheels move in the first place? Pedaling. Pedaling makes the wheels move. I get it. [*] And [*] I wonder how you [*] stop the [*] bicycle. There's two kinds of bikes. [*] One, with pedal brakes. How you turn the pedals this way to go? You just [*] turn it in reverse, [*] and it [*] stops the bike. [*] Then there's [*] some","29":"with [*] brakes on the handles. [*] And you do like this, and you [*] crunch it, and it stops. [*] One [*] brake on one handle will stop the front, and the other [*] brake on the other [*] hand will stop the back. Oh, okay. So that's two ways it can stop. And what holds the bike up when you're [*] riding it? [*] Well, if it's two wheels, it should [*] balance, [*] and if it's a [*] tricycle [*] that has [*] three wheels, that's for a little ton there. So with a two-wheeler, balance holds","30":"[*] Well, since you're new to Earth, you're probably going to have to [*] start off like this. There are these [*] wheels that you hook [*] onto the [*] bike that help you [*] ride, that help you ride it, so that you don't fall over [*] a lot of [*] times. [*] Okay, so those are special wheels that hook on? Yeah. Okay. Keep your light. Do you guys have a special name? Yeah, a drinking wheel. Okay. Do you want to tell me some more? Well, if you're on your bike and you see those little [*]","31":"pieces of [*] glass [*] from your car, they're called reflectors. Well, if you don't know about bikes, you don't know about [*] cars, so when car lights [*] flash [*] at you, they see the little [*] reflectors they see you going [*] by. [*] And [*] some bicycles even have oil light hooked on in front of them. Uh-huh. Yeah. And what's that for? Well, if you're riding at night, this is where you go. I see. And [*] whatever you do, whenever you're riding on a bike, don't drive [*] in the middle of the road, because,","32":"[*] well, [*] you [*] might get hit by a car. Okay. So you don't ride in the middle of the road, and [*] what makes the bike go, Steve? What makes it work? The little pedals on the side. Okay. They're hooked [*] onto this [*] chain that [*] runs around them, and the chain, they're hooked onto the big wheels, which way the big wheels go. [*] That's how you're going. I see. How [*] do you [*] turn the bicycle? Well, you're [*] hooked [*] onto the bike there, or [*] these [*] handles you hold [*]","33":"onto. You start off, [*] put [*] your feet on the pedals, [*] and hold onto [*] these bars, and, [*] well, that's how you hold onto it. So that's how that [*] works. Yeah, that's how that works. And how about [*] stopping? Stopping? How do you stop the bike? Well, [*] your feet are pushing the pedals [*] this way. Okay. Now [*] somebody calls [*] you to just pedal in the other way and stop it. Uh-huh. Okay. Or [*] there are [*] these [*] little things on the handles that stop the [*] bike, [*] or","34":"there's this metal bar hooked onto the bike and you push down. [*] Oh, okay. Or you just simply use your foot to stop. Or you could use your foot. Uh-huh. That's kind of dangerous. Because what could [*] happen? Well, if [*] on the [*] sidewalk like that, [*] if there's like a [*] hole in [*] the room where it leads into the sewer, [*] it [*] should [*] hit your foot along there. Yeah. Yeah, that could really hurt. [*] What holds the bike up? What holds the bike up? Well, [*] if you're using the training","35":"wheels, the training wheels do. Okay. But if you're not using them, you've got to try to [*] balance yourself. Oh, [*] balance. And [*] what's balance? [*] Well, you have to sort of keep the bike in a straight line. Uh-huh. But whatever it curves off one way, you've got to curve the opposite way. Oh, so when the bike curves one way, you curve the [*] opposite way. Yes, it will. And that's balancing. Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, you told me a lot about how a bicycle works. That was a lot. I think I know enough to","36":"[*] explain that to the other Martians. Is there anything else that I need to know? Anything else? About a bicycle. Uh-huh. [*] And [*] there's a little [*] seat [*] on the bicycle. [*] I don't know. It's a seat. And it's not like the kind of seat you're sitting on now. It's... [*] See how thin this is? Yeah. That's how thin it's going to be. [*] Okay, so it's a little [*] thin seat. Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, okay. Great. Well, you told me a lot. Now there's... And... Oh, one more thing? Go ahead. And the seat...","37":"[*] There's two petals in the seat. You can sit down and on the petals [*] there's a chain [*] of time [*] to a round thing that's [*] connected to the petals [*] and then [*] there's something to secure the seat and the petals which go. And then that goes down [*] to secure that [*] there's a big [*] tire [*] and [*] there's a round thing on there [*] attached to [*] those little metal [*] poles coming to the [*] tire [*] that it's attached to that makes it [*] spin and [*] from the","38":"[*] front there's [*] handlebars with things where you put your [*] hands and in the front there's a little [*] thing that you [*] squeeze back to make you [*] stop [*] and [*] the front is a tire [*] that once you parallel the back the front tire starts to go by itself. [*] So that's how it goes [*] and [*] how about when [*] you want to turn your bicycle? How do you do that? All you have to do is turn your handlebars whichever way you want to go. Oh you turn the handlebars okay","39":"and how do you [*] stop the bicycle? You just squeeze back on the things that are in front of the hand [*] on the hand [*] grips and you just pull back and then you stop. So you squeeze on the hand grips? Yeah, [*] well like the [*] little thing in front of it. What are those things called that [*] stopped the bicycle? Brakes. [*] And what holds the bicycle up? When you're not riding it. When you're riding it. [*] When you are riding it. What keeps it up? [*] When you're [*] riding your [*]","40":"Oh, it's [*] got [*] these chains connected to the wheels so that the wheels will stay here. So [*] there's lessons that you put your feet on [*] that I [*] think does go around with it. [*] Wheels go up and you have your hands. There are two things here. It's a [*] turn when you want to turn it. And then it's the front door. Wow, you just told me a lot. So it's got chains that are [*] connected to wheels. [*] And it's got [*] flat things that you put your [*] feet on. And","41":"[*] tell me how the flat things work. You [*] push them around so [*] it makes the wheel move. So when you push the flat things around that makes the wheel move. What does the chain have to do with it then? The [*] chain is [*] attached to the pedal move. Aha. [*] And the [*] pedal moves and [*] the chain moves too. [*] So when the pedal moves, the chain moves too. And then what happens? The chain is [*] attached to the wheels. Aha. So the chain is attached to the wheel and the wheel","42":"moves. Okay. So that's how it moves. And you said something about some things that you put your [*] hands on. So if you want to turn, you [*] turn it and [*] you want to go straight and just hold on to it. You want to go straight and just hold on to it. And do they have any particular name? Those things that you put your hands on? It's like a steering wheel. [*] It's like a steering wheel. And [*] how do you [*] stop your bike? [*] Well, [*] when you [*] make it move, you're","43":"pushing forwards. [*] But if you want to stop, you're going to push backwards and put your feet on the ground. Oh, so either you push backwards and put your feet on the ground. [*] Or just wait till the bike [*] runs [*] out of [*] power and stops. Or just wait till the bike runs out of power, [*] okay. And [*] what holds the bike up [*] when you're [*] going along? [*] When you're riding along? Look. You sit on it and balance. [*] You [*] balance? Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about","44":"[*] balancing? What's that like? [*] Balance. You sit on there and try to get [*] the weight equal on both sides. Oh, [*] you get your weight equal on both sides. So the bike doesn't fall down. And that's how it [*] stays up. And that's [*] balancing? Oh, great. [*] Well, I think I know just about enough about how a bike works to go and explain it to the other Martians. What do you think? Anything else I should know? You're supposed to wear a hard pin on your head so when you fall. Oh, you wear","45":"[*] It has [*] two [*] wheels, two wheels, uh-huh. And [*] you have to [*] add [*] petals. It has petals, uh-huh. [*] And [*] animals. [*] Animals. What kind of animals does it have? Are they any special shape? A long, [*] short? They're a little long. They're a little [*] long. And [*] so the bike you told me has wheels and petals and animals. Does it have any other parts? [*] Not really. Those are [*] really the main parts. [*] So what makes the bike move? What makes it come [*] with those parts? These","46":"petals [*] are in a [*] groove. So you pedal in a [*] groove to [*] pedal with any special part of your body? Your feet. So you pedal with your feet. And do the pedals make the bike move? Yeah. Uh-huh. Is there anything in [*] between [*] the pedals and the wheels? Or do the pedals push the wheels? Peddles push the wheels. Peddles push the wheels. Wow. What about when you want to stop your [*] bicycle? You have brakes. Oh, brakes? And how do you use those? [*] You push [*] down on the [*] pedals,","47":"They're petals and [*] what's weird on earth if something's going fast, it cuts through the air [*] and [*] keeps it [*] balanced. [*] So if you're [*] a beginner, you're not good [*] balanced. So they put these called training wheels on [*] and [*] what [*] it does is if you lean to one [*] side, even [*] if you're going [*] really [*] fast or really [*] slow, you're not going to fall down because the training wheels keep you from [*] falling down. I'm getting a picture here. Some bikes have training wheels, [*] but","48":"some don't. [*] Sometimes [*] people take them off and they're really [*] small [*] and they don't grow. Sometimes people don't grow anymore. [*] Well, then [*] sometimes they just take the training wheels off because they're bolted on with nails. [*] Does your bike have training wheels? No. [*] Because you're too big. [*] Well, not always. [*] When I was [*] eight, [*] well actually when I was [*] five, I [*] started riding a regular bike. I [*] fell all the time and I didn't want to do it. Then when I was [*] eight, I","49":"[*] really didn't. I fell [*] the first time. Then when I was nine, I don't get why. [*] At [*] the [*] late eights, at the early eights, I [*] fell. [*] Then at the late eights, for some reason, [*] I [*] just [*] got on a bike and I started riding and I didn't fall. When you got on and started riding, you told me there were pedals. What makes the pedals go? Do they just go by themselves? [*] No. You see, you have to [*] pedal with [*] what? [*] Here's the bike. [*] There's","50":"one wheel here, [*] one wheel here. There's a bar here. [*] This is just a little easy example. [*] There are all these other things. They're like these gears just to help you. [*] Then there's the [*] gears on the sides. [*] When you're in there, these [*] things sticking out like that, they're attached to these gears. When you pedal one [*] way, if you pedal this [*] over and down, this goes up. [*] You pedal like that. [*] You [*] hold onto the handlebars like [*] that. Then you pedal [*] and that makes the","51":"wheels go round and round. When you [*] pedal with your feet, [*] that makes the wheels go round and round. The faster you pedal, [*] the harder the wheels go. [*] Some bikes, [*] there [*] are [*] different things [*] attached, like [*] wires [*] attached. [*] That means if you pedal backwards, if you pedal like [*] this. If you pedal like put that foot back and that foot back [*] when you're [*] down. If you pedal like that, that means you're going forward. [*] Some bikes, if you pedal [*] backwards like that, it stops","52":"you. But other bikes, it has these things that are [*] attached to the [*] back. If you pull them, then it stops the bike. [*] What [*] are those things called? If you [*] squeeze them, they're on the handlebars? They're called brakes. [*] Some bikes stop when you squeeze the [*] brakes with your hands. [*] Some bikes stop [*] when you pedal backwards with your feet. It's [*] harder to [*] squeeze the handlebars because they get [*] thrust. Right. Pushing your feet on the pedals makes the pedals turn and makes the bike [*] go. Squeezing","53":"the brakes or pedaling backwards, depending on what bike it is, makes it stop. I'm wondering about something else. How do you [*] keep the bike up? If it's leaning, [*] it's [*] sort [*] of weird. The [*] faster you go, the easier it's to bounce. [*] But [*] if you're a beginner, [*] it's [*] hard to [*] explain. If [*] you're a beginner, the bike [*] stays [*] where [*] you are at the [*] beginning, but then you fall. But as you get used to it, if you keep on going, it's [*] sort of like,","54":"okay, you're trying to practice the penny drop. Do you know what that is? In [*] the first time, you'll [*] probably try it in the water, which is like training wheels. Because it's easier, you can flip yourself [*] if you're a good swimmer. Then you'll try it [*] with [*] someone [*] on [*] mid-air. And the more you [*] practice it, the better you get. It doesn't make really [*] sense that [*] you get better. So when you're riding a bike, you just get [*] better at balance, and the bike sticks up the more you","55":"do it. And also, there's one [*] funny thing, you never forget how to [*] ride a bike. That just [*] stays with you [*] no matter what. So you told me, your feet move the pedals, and then you go around and the bike moves, and the brakes [*] stop. And you [*] learn to balance by doing it over and over again. There's one more thing, a couple more things I was wondering about. Do the pedals just make the wheels move by [*] themselves, [*] or [*] is there something that [*] connects the pedals to the","56":"wheels? The [*] gears. Oh, they're gears. Yeah, [*] the gears are the things. [*] See, when the gears go round and round, the gears sort of [*] make the pedals [*] have these little things, and the gears have little [*] spaces between them, and also these little [*] circles, they can move around. [*] And if the gears get [*] untouched, [*] then it [*] won't work, because it will be hard to push, and you have to get them [*] back. I see. [*] And how [*] do you [*] see which way you're going on the","57":"bike? What if you're going along, and then you want to turn right to go into your driveway? Well, you just see, the [*] thing has a little turn [*] length. Okay. You have to... It's okay. I'll have to [*] get up again. Okay. Okay. [*] If you want to turn, [*] there are these handlebars, and if you [*] turn, it turns the front wheel, and [*] the back wheel just turns one thing, so you're going this way, you're going this way. And of course, there isn't, like, a block right here, so you can't sit. Where","58":"am I going? Where am I going? [*] Okay. It's just like, [*] this is here, this is here. [*] And there are [*] safety bikes that [*] do have, like, [*] some [*] safety bikes from [*] beginners that do have, like, a [*] pad right here, so [*] if you crash, then you'll hit that. [*] Okay. [*] So, the bikes are pretty safe, because [*] as long as they're in your [*] control, [*] then... And the easy part of that [*] bike [*] is, [*] you can, [*] if you're [*] riding in a car seat,","59":"you can turn one way, turn the other way. It's not like you have to [*] scoop the bike like [*] that. Right. So you turn like that. You turn it. You [*] see... Okay, you're going straight like this. You turn this, and you turn. [*] You turn this, and you turn. You turn this, [*] and you're just going. You turn the handlebars. Yeah. You turn the handlebars, which way. [*] And, of course, if you're following this way, you turn the handlebars that way. And [*] sometimes, well, that's what I do. My dad told me, if","60":"[*] You [*] get up on the seat [*] and [*] you put [*] your feet on the pedal [*] and [*] then [*] you [*] start pushing the pedal around that [*] and [*] you don't look like left or right, you look straight so you can stay up. Uh-huh, uh-huh. [*] So your feet push the [*] pedal round and round [*] and [*] then what happens? You can ride somewhere. And then you can ride somewhere? So are the pedals, what makes the bike go or is there something else on the bike that makes it move?","61":"[*] Well, the pedals make the wheels go. The pedals make the wheels turn. Are the pedals [*] attached to the wheels? Is that what happens? That's why they [*] turn? Yeah. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay. And what about when you're going along and you [*] want to stop [*] your bicycle, how do you do that? You push [*] one of [*] your [*] pedals [*] back with one of your [*] foot [*] and [*] you stop. So you push the pedal back with one of your feet and that makes you [*] stop. Okay. One more [*] thing.","62":"What about if you're riding along on your [*] street, [*] right? [*] And [*] then [*] you get to your driveway and you want to turn in to go home for dinner or something. How do you turn the [*] bicycle? Um, [*] well, there's a handle and you can turn it up. Oh, there are handles that you [*] put your hands on and you can turn it like that? Uh-huh. One more thing I [*] don't [*] quite understand about bikes is what [*] keeps them up [*] when you're going along? The bike is kind of","63":"Well you have to be [*] balanced and you have to [*] be warmed up to like pedal a lot if you're going [*] around the [*] block a few times. Could I interrupt? You have to be balanced. What does that mean? Like you have to be able to, there's only two wheels and it's like if you [*] first get on you'll [*] fall straight or you have to be like [*] at the, [*] like run or you can just sit on and [*] put one foot [*] down and start pedaling real hard and that's how","64":"you get to be [*] balanced. I see. Like [*] this is how I learned how to ride a bike. I was like five years old anyway. There's someone that moved [*] like a few years ago like [*] two [*] and he was riding his bike and I said could I try because he had these things on the back that he could stand on. Oh really? And I couldn't stand on them because it was too complicated so I got on the bike and I just [*] pushed him. I said to my mom can you take the","65":"wheels [*] off my bike and she told my dad he took them right off and I zoomed right off. [*] Wow so that's how you learned to ride a bike huh? [*] What is it that makes your bike move? Well it's just like [*] a dirt bike or a motorcycle. It has an engine but bikes [*] don't have an engine. It [*] has [*] pedals that you have to [*] push [*] right? Sometimes [*] complicated if you're going up hills. [*] You don't have to put, you can just go [*] down [*] without pushing if","66":"you're going down on a hill. Like go [*] down with [*] that. What happens when you push on the pedals? [*] Well like you start to go and keep on pushing harder and harder to go even [*] faster, keep on going. What makes the [*] wheels go around? The pedals [*] it has [*] and there's brakes [*] and there's handle brakes and [*] the pedals [*] if you push backwards, some bikes have it. You press backwards and there are the [*] brakes [*] where some bikes you can just [*] press back and the wheels, I","67":"[*] recall it [*] goes around [*] and it makes my flickery [*] noise and [*] for that bike you have to use the handle bar brakes. I see. Now [*] you said that when you push [*] on the pedals that makes the wheels move. Are the pedals attached to the wheels? Well it's [*] attached to the middle of the [*] bike. It doesn't make the front wheel move. Oh [*] okay so they're attached to the middle of the bike. [*] When you move frontwards there's a chain that [*] holds it that goes. Oh there's a","68":"chain. That brings the back wheel. And the chain brings the back wheel? [*] Sometimes this happens to my bike the chain falls off [*] so [*] when you ride the pedals just go like that. Oh my gosh. [*] Well [*] it's [*] connected so it [*] cannot [*] all come off just like the front and your hands get all greasy when you're trying to put it back on. Really? [*] Is it hard to put it back on? Yeah real hard because it's tight and so it won't come off. [*] I see. [*] So the [*]","69":"chain is connected to the [*] pedals and the wheels. Only one wheel and [*] the pedals [*] are [*] actually not connected they're just hooked on. [*] It's real hard to push and [*] you get [*] used to it when you keep on doing it. Do you? Yeah. And how do you [*] steer the bike? You know where the front brakes are you know what I mean? [*] Yeah we told [*] them. They have a seat that goes down and it has a bar [*] and [*] they [*] all have bars that connect to things.","70":"Right. [*] And there's a bar that brings it up and then you can loosen it and stuff to make the [*] handle bars go up and down. Like if you get [*] bigger. [*] I see. [*] So if you get taller [*] you [*] would change [*] the size of the bike. You can make the seat up [*] and let [*] me call it the [*] front [*] handle bars. Oh the handle bars. Uh huh. Wow. [*] I think I know a lot about bikes now. You think I know enough to go back and tell","71":"How it works itself or [*] what you do. [*] Tell [*] me what makes your bicycle go. When you [*] pedal, it turns [*] the [*] back wheel. And [*] while that is [*] working, it [*] makes the bike go forward. [*] And [*] you have the steering wheel in front of you [*] turning the front wheel where you want to go. [*] So while the back wheel is [*] turning, the [*] front wheel is [*] turning the way you want it to go. I see. So you have a steering wheel [*] that goes the","72":"way you want it to go. Hey, I have to teach you what ami's and ami's and [*] add. You would have to teach me all the words [*] too? [*] No, I can [*] give you a dictionary. That's right. And we'll pretend that I'm a [*] Martian who already learned English. Okay, so that way you don't have to tell me what all the little words of it. I [*] would like to know [*] a little more about the bicycle because I have a picture of it in my head now from what you told me. But","73":"[*] I [*] still don't know [*] how you [*] stop the [*] bicycle. Well, when you [*] push [*] backwards on the pedal, [*] it's [*] like [*] turning the wheel [*] the other way, but you can't go [*] very far. [*] So it's turning the wheel the other way, [*] and it'll [*] stop where I can't go any farther, [*] stopping the [*] bike. Oh, so that's what stops the bike. I think that's right. Does that sound right to you? Yeah. That's what you remember from riding your bike, right? [*] Yeah. That certainly makes","74":"a lot of sense to me. Tell me about what [*] holds the bike up [*] when you're riding. The wheels. Well, [*] there's two kinds of sub-bikes. The [*] first bike is where you have that kind of bike, [*] and it's too low [*] for [*] wheels. It's a little [*] pipe sticking out with two wheels [*] keeping the balance, so the wheel goes forward. But then when you get older, you learn how to keep your balance on the bike. And you can take those [*] things off, and then you keep the balance [*] yourself.","75":"[*] Just look straight, and you'll keep the balance. So by looking [*] straight [*] and riding the bike, [*] it keeps it balanced. I see. [*] Is there anything else you think I would need to know [*] about how a bike works? Anything [*] you haven't told me yet or I haven't asked you? The signals? No, tell me about the signals. [*] This means stop. You have to [*] know [*] how [*] to [*] control. [*] If you don't want to accident with the other cars, you have to [*] tell the cars where you go.","76":"Don't you go the opposite direction. This means stop. Uh-huh. This means [*] left. This means right. Oh, okay. There's always [*] ride on the left here. You ride on the left-hand [*] side. Why is that? Because you're [*] used to drive left here, and that's the way the traffic works. Mm-hmm. [*] Mm-hmm. Okay. [*] Well, I think I know enough now to go and tell the other Martians. Oh, and one more thing. Oh, is it one more thing? Follow all the rules, cars, stuff. Oh, okay. Except if you [*] don't have the [*] speed, they","77":"really break. Mm-hmm. You don't have to control the speed. Mm-hmm. I see. Did you say some bikes have [*] speeds? Yes. No. What are those? [*] What are speeds? Well, it tells you how fast you're going. Mm-hmm. There's all [*] other stuff [*] you have to [*] have on your bike. You always have to wear a helmet. Mm-hmm. If you're under 12, especially, you get a ticket. Mm-hmm. Thirty-four dollars, I think. Mm. And [*] 32. [*] Mm-hmm. Something like that. There's also, [*] you have to have a light when it's [*] dark out. Mm-hmm. You","78":"have to have like eight, do I think eight reflectors on your bike? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So other people know you're there. What are reflectors? There's stuff that [*] reflect off of the light that's there. Mm-hmm. Maybe the flashing thing. Mm-hmm. So you get [*] people [*] driving close when you're there. Oh, and you started to tell me earlier about the [*] speeds, but I don't think [*] I heard all about that. What are [*] speeds on a bicycle, and what do they do? They tell you how fast the [*] bike is going. They tell you how","79":"[*] Well, [*] there's a chain, and there's two wheels, and [*] then it goes like [*] this, and then the tire looks up, and then [*] the other thing over here, [*] and then [*] there's [*] a [*] chain, and then the chain [*] runs the wheels, because [*] it, like, cooks on to the wheels. And [*] then there's pedals, like, right here, and then you [*] push them down, and then [*] pedals. Who pushed them down with? Who part of your body would you? Oh, your feet. Your feet, and then, then you have a","80":"handlebar she's dealing with, and then she's dealing, and then I do. How about when you want to stop? Oh, you. Well, it certainly kind of bites you, these brakes that peel, like, squeeze near the handlebar. [*] And [*] then, you just look at these brakes that you push, you push back on the pedals and it stops. Oh, [*] I [*] see. Well, now you know what? I could go back to [*] Mars, and I could tell everybody how to ride a bike now. [*] That's great. And there's a seat. Oh, there's a seat, too. [*]","81":"There's these two things on the bottom, you put your feet [*] on them, [*] then [*] push with your legs, and there's [*] this thing that you put your arms on to [*] steer, [*] then you can [*] steer wherever [*] you [*] want to, then [*] you can go [*] places much faster than [*] walking. [*] So there's two things on the bottom that you put your feet on, [*] and [*] what do they do? They make you [*] move. [*] And then you said there's something that you put your hands on? It's on","82":"the top, and then you can [*] steer the bicycle, [*] and then you can [*] turn, and stuff just going [*] straight, [*] and if you really have to turn, if there's a dead end, you might have, [*] and there's [*] brakes, if there's a dead end. Oh, what are [*] brakes? What do brakes do? Brakes like help you [*] stop those pedal brakes and [*] hand brakes. Oh, and what are pedal brakes? Pedal brakes are the things on the bottom, and you push backwards, [*] and then you can stop, and there's two kinds of","83":"brakes. The other kind of brake has the hand [*] thing that makes you slow down, and [*] if you push back on the pedal, it just [*] keeps going [*] backwards. And how do the hand brakes work? They'll slow you down, [*] but [*] the [*] kind I just said, they make you stop because [*] I have two kinds. I have the hand brakes and the pedal brakes, [*] and [*] you have to pump the [*] tire, [*] like [*] two things on the front and the [*] back. [*] Then you can like, won't like","84":"get [*] flat, then you can't like [*] fly it. [*] How do you pump the tire? [*] There. [*] Since I'm a Martian, I'm still a little [*] confused [*] because I don't quite get how [*] you put your feet, it sounds like you put your [*] feet on [*] something, and that makes the bike move. Can you tell me more about that? What are you putting your [*] feet on? Pedals. Oh, [*] pedals. They [*] like [*] hit them with your hand and they don't spin [*] around, [*] so they don't [*] have to","85":"keep moving their foot, [*] like [*] trying [*] to [*] tie your [*] feet in knots. Uh-huh. So you put your feet on the [*] pedals and push, and then what happens? [*] Then you move, like the bike, the back tire starts to move and the front tire [*] starts to move, but if there's like a deep hill, you don't really have to pedal, but if you want to, you can get [*] speed in. So the pedals make the [*] wheels move? Uh-huh. The wheels do. Do the pedals touch the wheels? Does that have anything?","86":"No. Like there's this chain that goes. Oh, there's a chain. [*] There's this chain that goes, [*] like, from the [*] pedal [*] thing back, and there's this, [*] like, [*] grip thing that, like, that, [*] like, that [*] moves and, like, circle, [*] and, [*] like, makes the chain move, then it [*] makes [*] the wheel move. Uh-huh. Like, [*] you start to move. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I [*] see. What holds the bike up? Um, [*] like [*] bars and [*] screws. [*] Bars and screws hold it up. When you're moving [*] along with it,","87":"[*] Well, [*] you [*] sit on a ceiling of a sofa, and then you [*] look, and you find the pedals, and [*] you put your feet on the pedals, and then you start to turn your feet around on the pedals, and then your bike goes. But you have to keep the bike steady so you don't fall over. You have to keep the bike [*] steady so you don't fall over. And how do you keep the bike [*] steady? But [*] just like turning the thing a little, and like [*] keeping balance. Turning the thing?","88":"Yeah, what kind of [*] thing [*] would that be? On the handlebars. Oh, you turn the handlebars, and you keep your balance, and that's what keeps it [*] steady. And what were you telling me [*] before about something you do with your [*] feet? You put your feet on the pedals, [*] and then you start to move your feet with your feet forward, [*] and the pedals [*] have [*] attached to a chain [*] on the back bicycle, and the front [*] wheel goes to the middle just the right way. And the bicycle on the","89":"back gives it the rest [*] of the wheel and the front [*] will give it a little bit of power and start to move. So that's how it [*] moves. How does it stop? Well, there's two ways. You can push your foot back [*] from some steps, [*] or there might be [*] little bars in front of the handlebars [*] that you [*] squeeze into stuff. Is there anything else that you think I should know about how a bicycle works, or do you think that that [*] covers it? That [*] covers it. That [*] covers","90":"[*] You just [*] pedal. You pedal. [*] What [*] do you pedal? Yes. You put your foot on it and you can [*] put it on your step or your foot. Oh, so you pedal it with your feet and [*] how do you make sure it goes where you want it to go? [*] Uh-huh. I like it. It has to be the right size [*] for it. So a speed bike has things that [*] you squeeze with your hands when you want [*] to stop. But the other kind of thing is you can put your","91":"foot [*] on it. It has to be the right size for it. So a speed bike has [*] things that you squeeze when you want to stop, [*] but the other kind of bike you [*] use pedals and pedal and you go backward when you want to stop. Is that right? [*] Uh-huh. [*] Okay, so that's how you go and that's how you [*] stop. [*] And if you want, you have a speed bike, you can [*] come up and jump. [*] What are they? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I [*] have one [*] more question now.","92":"Well, [*] Roosters, [*] it has two wheels, and [*] it also has these pedals, and when you pedal it, there's these gears, and then [*] there's a chain in these gears, and when you pedal it makes [*] the chain move, and [*] then [*] the gears are attached to this wheel, and then [*] the wheels start to turn, which makes it very simple to go. Oh, so [*] you pedal on pedals, and then that makes the gears turn, and then the gears make the wheels turn? Yeah. Is that right? [*] How do you [*] stop?","93":"[*] You stop [*] by using the brakes, or by moving it, [*] or by pushing the [*] pedals backwards, [*] because to make the wheel, you have to push it [*] forward. Oh, so to make the bike go, you push the brakes forward, and to make it stop, you push them backwards. Or you use the brakes. Or you use the brakes. [*] And what are brakes? Well, they [*] stop the [*] wheels. They stop the wheels? And how do you do that? Well, because [*] they're kind of like these things that when you pull them,","94":"it's [*] attached [*] to these other [*] things that kind of go like this, and [*] when you press it, it makes these things on the bottom go like this, which [*] is like the part of the wheel which makes it [*] stop. [*] I see. And what about [*] if you can't turn anymore? So then they can't turn anymore? Yeah. So that's what makes the brakes work. Yeah. They make [*] it so that the wheel can't turn [*] anymore? Yeah. Mm-hmm. How about when you're riding down your driveway, and then [*] you want to","95":"turn into the [*] street? [*] How does the bicycle do that? Well, there's also [*] the front [*] wheel right there, the handlebars, and the handlebars are kind of attached. The front wheel and the front wheel can move it. And if you turn the [*] handlebars, it makes the bicycle turn. So when you turn the [*] handlebars, that makes the bicycle turn. I see. [*] And what holds the bike up [*] when you're riding? Balance. Oh, balance. How does that work? The counterparts are like four. Yeah. [*] Well, [*] you have to try to like","96":"[*] go straight while you're on [*] the pedals, [*] and [*] you have to kind of go [*] straight. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you go [*] straight. Mm-hmm. Your body [*] has to be [*] straight. Oh. And also, [*] that's more that you make the bicycle go [*] fast, but I pedal with it faster. Oh, so you go [*] straight, and you keep your body [*] straight, and you pedal. Yeah, that'll help it work even better. And that'll help it work even better. Wow. Well, [*] I think I know a lot about bicycles now and how","97":"Well, you put on a helmet [*] to protect your head, [*] and you get on a bike. [*] It has two wheels, and it can be any [*] color, and it can be little, medium, or big. There's a seat for you to sit on your hand or the [*] students. You get on [*] the two [*] pedals sticking out, [*] and you [*] turn your legs, [*] and two legs are making a sucker, and [*] the wheels [*] spin, and the little [*] things sticking out start to spin, and that makes the wheels move, so","98":"then you start to move, [*] and then you can go anywhere you want. Wow, so that's what makes the wheels move. So [*] just your feet on [*] the foot things is what makes the wheels move? Okay, is there anything else that makes the wheels move? Oh, when you're going downhill. Oh, how does that work? Because [*] it's honestly when you're at the top, and when you go down, [*] gravity is sort of like... There's something about [*] gravity [*] that makes you move when you're going from the top to the bottom? I see. Well,","99":"what about when you're riding along on a flat road, and you want to [*] stop? How do you do that? The two [*] things sticking out of [*] the [*] white side of the handle spin, you push on it, and [*] the two little things that attach to the wheels [*] touch the wheels and make the wheels stop, so you stop. [*] I see. Two little things that touch the wheels that are next to the wheels. The brakes. Oh, they're the brakes. I [*] see. [*] And [*] what about when you're riding along and you","100":"You have to [*] get on the seat, and [*] you put your feet on the pedals, [*] and then you start [*] pushing your feet around in a circle, [*] and you put your hands on the handlebars, and then [*] you ride. So you get on the [*] seat, [*] you put your feet on the pedals, and what do you do with your feet? You push them [*] around in a circle. When you push them around in a circle, and then what happens? [*] Then you put your [*] hands on the handlebars. And you put","101":"your hands on the handlebars. So, [*] what moves on the [*] bicycle when you push your [*] feet on the pedals? The wheels. Oh, [*] so the pedals make the wheels move? Mm-hmm. Is there anything in [*] between the [*] pedals and the wheels? Yes. [*] I wonder what? The chain. Oh, the [*] chain. [*] See, I'm a Martian. Yeah, I just don't know these things. [*] Okay, so there's the [*] chain. So [*] the pedals turn, that turns the chain, and the chain turns the wheels. Right? Okay. Now, so I see you're going along,","102":"right? And [*] then what about when you want to stop? You [*] push your feet the other way. Oh, really? And then what happens? Do you go backwards? No. No? What happens? You [*] stop. You stop. [*] How about when you [*] need to turn? How do you do that? I need to turn the handlebars. Oh, really? And what does that do? It turns you. Is it turning? The bike. It turns you and the bike? What are they connected to? The wheels. Oh, I get it. Okay, now I'm starting to get a picture of it.","103":"[*] It has pedals [*] and [*] you push them and it's [*] connected to a chain with the wheel [*] and you sit in a seat and it has metal bars [*] and you pedal the pedals [*] and [*] it goes faster [*] and you get it with [*] the [*] handle bars and [*] you're riding around the whole neighborhood all over the world. So that tells me how it works. [*] What makes your bike [*] stop? How do you stop your bike? [*] On [*] some, there are brakes on the handle bars. What are","104":"brakes? [*] You press them down [*] and they [*] go against the tires [*] and they stop the tires from moving [*] and they [*] stop [*] moving [*] and [*] you're sitting there for another reason. Once you've stopped. [*] Now what if you're riding along and then you get to your friend's house [*] and you want to turn into your friend's driveway. How do you do that on your bike? You move the handle bars [*] whichever way you want to turn. I [*] see. And what holds the bike up? On two wheels, [*] it's","105":"the speed that holds it up. [*] It's a [*] balance. On [*] more, it's the wheels just to make your wheels. On [*] bikes that have more wheels? [*] When you say [*] balance holds the bike up, what do you mean? What's balance? Balance [*] is, [*] I [*] don't know. It's hard to describe, isn't it? The balance is what holds the bike up. [*] You said that when you pedal the pedals, then the wheels [*] move. [*] Tell me a little bit more about how that works. You pedal the pedals and it moves the","106":"What was your bicycle work? Well, it had [*] two wheels. Uh-huh. It has two wheels, it has [*] bars that hold the wheels on. Two wheels and bars that hold the wheels on. Okay. I'm picturing that. Hand the bars. Uh-huh. And some of them have [*] little reflectors. Uh-huh. And [*] they have pedals. Uh-huh. The pedals hold on to this [*] chain that makes the wheels [*] go [*] round. Uh-huh. And you can [*] press down the pedal to make the brake go. Uh-huh. Or there's this little wire [*] from the wheel. There's this little","107":"wire [*] from the brake [*] to the handlebar. Uh-huh. And they're called handbrakes. You press it down and [*] it [*] stops the bike. So when you press down on the handbrake, that stops the bike. How does that happen again? What makes that [*] happen? [*] Well, there's this, when you press it down, there's this wire [*] thing that goes down to the brake part. Uh-huh. When you press it, it, [*] like, tights this thing. Uh-huh. And makes the wheels real tight and [*] stops the bike. Oh, it makes the wheels really tight. Oh, okay.","108":"These things come down, [*] like, here's the [*] wheel. Uh-huh. And the things come down, like, shh. Uh-huh. Okay. You squeeze the bike, then it couldn't go. Uh-huh. So that's how it works? Uh-huh. Um, [*] how about, like, if you're riding down the [*] street and then you want to turn into your driveway because you've gotten home or something, how do you turn the bike? Because the front handlebars, [*] there's this [*] big bar that hooks to the wheel. So when you turn the handlebars, the front wheel turns, too. [*] Oh, and you turn the","109":"handlebars. You have to keep [*] riding. Oh, I see. [*] Okay. And you told me how the bike [*] stops [*] by the brakes. [*] What holds [*] the bike up? Oh, well, there's the kickstand. Mm-hmm. Kick it up and down. Mm-hmm. Like, you hook it onto your bike. Like, when it's down, you just kick it up. Mm-hmm. When it's up, [*] you, like, push it down to make it stop. Mm-hmm. Okay. [*] When it's up, you, like, push it down to make it stand up. [*] Mm-hmm. Well, for some [*] bikes, they [*] have","110":"training wheels. Mm-hmm. [*] Sometimes [*] for [*] starters on bikes. And [*] you don't need kickstand because [*] they have, [*] like, [*] the two-wheel bike and you hook on these little tiny wheels. Mm-hmm. [*] Oh. How about when you're [*] riding the bike? What holds it up? Um, [*] well, you just have to keep going on [*] the pedals and you have to stay [*] balanced. Oh, you stay [*] balanced? And you have to... What does that mean, [*] staying [*] balanced? Um, [*] like, stay, um... [*] Like, keep pedaling? Mm-hmm. Oh. So it","111":"means you keep pedaling... Not, like, going [*] sideways. [*] Uh-huh. And when you're not going [*] sideways... Just go straight. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Going [*] straight up. And [*] steady. Mm-hmm. And just... Mm-hmm. Just keep pedaling. Mm-hmm. That's how you do it. When you stop, you push the pedal down. Mm-hmm. Or you, um, put the... You squeeze the handle brake. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, I think that gives me a lot of [*] information about bikes. I think I know enough to [*] explain it to the other Martians. I have to go back and explain it","112":"It rides along the street. It rides along the [*] street, okay. [*] What kind of parts does a [*] bicycle have? Does it make it ride? [*] Wheels. It has [*] wheels. Does the wheels turn all the way up and south? Or is there something you have to do? [*] Pedal. Or you have to pedal? Do you pedal with your ears? No. [*] With your feet. Oh, your feet. I see. So you pedal with your feet and the wheels turn. [*] Now, [*] what [*] makes the [*] bike [*] stop? You need to stop. Yeah.","113":"Press the brakes. Oh, the brakes. What are those? They're things where you just stop. Things where you just [*] stop. Do you press them [*] with your [*] hands or with your feet? With your [*] feet. Oh, with your [*] feet. I see.

How about when you're, so you're riding down the street and you see your house and you want to turn into your driveway. What makes the bike turn? You have to","114":"go like this.

What keeps it up [*] when you're riding along? What keeps it from just, you know, you're riding along? Meals. Oh, wheels keep it up. Oh. Okay. And now you think I'm ready to go [*] to the [*] forecast tomorrow? All right. [*] Sounds good to me. Now, before I do that, I think you are ready.","115":"work. [*] You have to [*] paddle. Paddle? [*] Mm-hmm. [*] And the [*] wheels [*] will move. You paddle and the wheels will move? Uh-huh. You have to [*] steer. And you have to [*] steer. How do you steer? [*] By the [*] handles. [*] Oh, by the handles? Uh-huh. And your [*] legs. What do the brakes do? They stop you. Oh, they [*] stop you? Well, um, [*] how do you make the brakes work? Do you touch them with your nose? Mm-hmm. No? [*] Oh, how do you do it? You need to use your","116":"feet. [*] Use your feet? Oh, that handle brake. [*] Oh, so there are feet brakes and also handle brakes. Yeah. [*] So, say you're pedaling with your [*] feet. [*] How does that make the wheels go around? Well, it has [*] a [*] chain that goes around the wheels. [*] Oh, [*] there's a chain that goes around the wheels. So, when you [*] pedal, that makes the wheels turn? Mm-hmm. I [*] see. Now, what about when you're riding along your [*] street [*] and you want to turn into your driveway? How do you do that?","117":"I [*] have to put on my [*] brakes and go slower. You have to put on your brakes and go slower? Mm-hmm. And I see. What [*] about, um, [*] how do you stay up on your [*] bicycle? [*] I don't know. You don't know? You just [*] do? [*] Something keeps you up? Mm-hmm. Yeah? [*] Oh, well, that sounds pretty good. But as [*] you move, you will [*] stay up. After you're moving, it'll keep you [*] up? [*] You'll stay up? Good. Now, um, is there anything else you can tell me about how","118":"a bicycle moves? What's that? [*] Mm-hmm. When [*] you're [*] riding, if you want to turn, [*] if you're going along [*] in a circle, [*] the handle will [*] go to the front wheel [*] and [*] turn.
